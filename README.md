# ❤️ Heart Disease Dataset Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a heart disease dataset using Power BI to identify important demographic and clinical factors associated with heart disease. The objective is to convert raw healthcare data into meaningful insights through effective data cleaning, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Project
To analyze heart disease data and uncover trends, patterns, and risk indicators using Power BI visualizations that support data-driven healthcare insights.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes patient demographic and medical attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and exercise-related indicators. The target variable indicates whether a patient has heart disease.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing values using appropriate methods  
- Corrected data types for accuracy  
- Validated categorical variables  
- Created meaningful labels for improved readability  

Data preprocessing was performed using **Power Query**.

---

## 🔢 Key Metrics (DAX)
- Total Patients  
- Heart Disease Patients  
- No Heart Disease Patients  
- Disease Percentage  
- Average Age  
- Average Cholesterol  
- High-Risk Patient Count  

These metrics were created using **DAX measures** to enable dynamic and interactive analysis.

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- KPI cards summarizing key metrics  
- Visualizations showing disease distribution across age, gender, and clinical factors  
- Interactive slicers for filtering and focused analysis  
- Clean and user-friendly dashboard layout  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query  
- DAX  
- Kaggle Dataset  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Heart disease prevalence increases with age  
- Certain chest pain types show higher association with heart disease  
- Cholesterol and heart rate are important clinical indicators  
- Higher disease occurrence observed among male patients  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights the effective use of Power BI for healthcare data analysis. By combining data cleaning, DAX-based metrics, and interactive dashboards, the project delivers meaningful insights into heart disease patterns and demonstrates the value of data visualization in healthcare analytics.
